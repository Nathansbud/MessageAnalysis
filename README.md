# Message Analysis

A nifty, on-going project (currently in very early stages) in analyzing and visualizing information from users' usage of language on social media platforms ୧[•-•]୨

## Progress

So far, this project is tailored towards parsing data from the most used social media platforms. I have loosely started work on the following platforms:

- Facebook
    -  Messages 
- Discord
    - Messages

## To-Do

- Attach provided timestamps to messages (Unix time parsing)
- Download and analyze Instagram data
- Begin work on trend analysis and data visualization
- Branch out in Facebook data analysis—posts, gender-based trends...
- Improve robustness of current file-handling system
- Create platform for hosting data
