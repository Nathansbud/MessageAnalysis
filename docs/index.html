    <h1>A Stupid Analysis of One Teenager's Usage of Language</h1>
    <p>Recently, I learned that both Discord and Facebook allow users to request a copy of nearly ALL of their data.</p>
    <p>This, of course, includes all messages sent by the user on the platform.</p>
    <p>So, being the idiot that I am, I decided to take the plunge, and do some analysis of my use of language on these two platforms!</p>
    <p><strong>I'm lazy, so it's definitely not going to be perfect.</strong> Hopefully, though, it's worth a few minutes of your time!</p>
